# This Project is crafted by Md.Aman

# In this project we have created a tax calculation application that helps us calculate out overall income in a year.
# In this we calculated tax on basis of gross total income, extra income the deductions and the age we are in right now.
# The page shows all the requirements as asked it has proper tooltips and error handling as required.
# The Page is completely made with the help of HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT and using libraries like BootStrap and JQuery.
# Added styling and made a hovering smooth animation when we hover over the container and tried.
# The error message is also created as a tooltip which is shown above the icon.
# If we enter correct value in error input box the error goes automatically and each input field is checked one by one from top so that it gets stopped where the error is and we resolve that error to move forward.
# For proper understanding all the codes have a proper comments added.
